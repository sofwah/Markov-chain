5 years since the release of End Credits, a piece of music that changed my life.

thank you‚Ä¶

its a beautiful morning.

whens the last time you just shut the fuck up.

common ground.

live stream in a few.

man im super into you being like a production god father for all these kids.

this is true.

that was a weird few months.

what a relief it is to like making music again.

i need to stop dislocating my shoulder please.

i dont have a big enough brain to extrapolate what this headline means in a physical sense.

out now.

stream on all platforms, and a limited edition vinyl out too.

spontaneous connection to the music. songs that mightnt fit elsewhere, or that wouldnt have existed otherwise.

a new song out.

i just wanted to take some time to say thank you to all of you for following along.

aCcEpT mE iN fAcEbOoK.

i hope you guys are ready for üó°Ô∏è music.

new music.

this is a madness.

is this a vid from my house in march.

shout out to the gamer bois who submit themselves to be the guinea pigs of this.

ok, should be good for everything aside from vertigo i think.

this is insane.

time to be less shit than i was before.

think that was the longest ive slept all year.

thank you for the music.

where does that leave us now?

its nice to play it really loud.

new music on wednesday.

this is incredible.

do you think were going to make it?

BREONNA TAYLOR needs her justice. this isn‚Äôt over. keep protesting.

end credits ep should be ok to play, ill check with umg for the rest.

DISLOYAL WTF????

all this religious imagery forgiveness shit makes me so uncomfortable.

is this guy trying to arugue biology with a biologist?

if you are confused by the defund the police conversation.

ok sean 86493415 who is definitely not a bot - glad to see youre against the immigration.

im sorry this shit is so distressing - but this is the reality that far to many people live through.

maybe 2500 people out today. even more at the march on monday. proud of dublin right now. black lives matter.

there were maybe 100 of us protesting last saturday.

oh yeah they said that it was solidarity to press.

they quit because they wouldnt be supported by the city when they brutalize protesters.

thank you for sharing this.

people in the u.s, a text to help end police brutality

any time someone says we need obama back.

i am proud to say that our team will also be donating all of our proceeds. not just profit. everything. take care x.

it is a very weird world to be releasing music into. i hope that if you need it you can loop this one.

bro its kpop fans wrecking the hashtags.

literally nothing they could have done prior to this video would make it justified.

thank you.

film everything.

i feel ill.

this is very important viewing.

again this comes down to conflict de-escalation.

bro if you think riots dont work you are mis informed.

if this is the best way fucking shoot me first.

man this reply is breaking my fucking heart. it might be what you need?

i completely agree.

an attempt and no hits is still an attempt.

you right. not tryna insight shit, just shine a light.

thats cool, but this shits still happening even if you sheild your eyes from it. take care of yourself.

im just holding up a mirror man.

so please pick a fucking side.

i could go on.

for people in dublin.

no more social media for me because im gonna throw up.

i found it this morning and couldnt take my eyes off it.

that hurts man.

the world has never felt more accutely on fire.

i know sorry i was breaking the law.

fucking lol.

this is incredible.

5 weeks of which i didnt even go outside.

talking about being at home for the last 10 weeks.

i see you you see through me.

my guy never let them touch that shit.

love this song, love you.

i want to say thank you so much to everyone who had bought tickets, please go get refunds and look after yourselves.

unfortunately all shows are now cancelled. we had everything rearranged for later this year.

most of the time.

i just look at the image i dont know how to read.

me too.

a very refreshing vision of our current state.

me too tbh.

its about me.

i miss my friends.

new music in 48 hours.

irish experimental(?) producer.

listened to this for the first time today and was pretty floored by it.

def one of my favourite releases of the year so far.

the first thing i ever bought on bandcamp a few years back (2016?).

and lastly, i have a new song coming out next week.

this is such a shit corporate boomer idea that its accidentally great? autonomous slideshow creation. someone at apple is living in 3020.

my friends iphone made him an unsolicited slideshow of the day we shot the album cover ahahaha.

sending love man, hope youre good.

this will forever blow my mind.

i would like to thank yung lean for only playing my favourite songs on his stream thank you yung lean.
